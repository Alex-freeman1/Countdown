This script intends to reenact the word game of the British game show _Countdown_

You select how many people are playing and enter in their names. After choosing your letters, the famous music starts counting down

Whoever comes up with the longest word, gets points equal the length of the word

When you decide to stop playing, the winner of the game will be announced (and who is taking home the countdown tea pot)
